# 🌸 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier on the Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm using the famous **Iris flower dataset**. The goal is to classify flowers into one of three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* based on features such as petal and sepal length/width.

## 📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of **150 samples** of iris flowers, each described by 4 features:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Target classes:
- 0 → Setosa
- 1 → Versicolor
- 2 → Virginica
